---Huug Van den Dool (Dec 2019)
The question was to update the annual solar constant Table for EMC’s models run by NCO, 
for 1850 to ‘present’ plus a forecast to about 2030. I have replied to a similar request 
in 2005 and 2011, the write up for 2011 is 1.5 pages down (still relevant).

This time we rely on reconstructed TSI (Total Solar Irradiance or S) data produced elsewhere, 
downloaded from  https://spot.colorado.edu/~koppg/TSI/   for 1750-2018 (2019 not yet available).
Advantage: these are annual S numbers already, so no hassle of ‘daily’ data as before.  
For the period 1979-2018 I assume these are actually measurements by satellite (calibrated 
and calibrated some more). For 1979-2018 we also downloaded annual sunspot numbers (N) derived 
from http://sidc.oma.be/silso/datafiles .  For 1979-2018 we then find S=0.004*N +1361 as 
regression with a modest 0.83 correlation.  This regression is applied to the predicted 
sunspot number (N) out of SWPC (their latest update of the forecast for solar cycle 25 
made in Dec 2019). This yields estimates of the solar constant S for 2019-2033. (This is 
a little farther out than 11 years since SWPC expects a very long next cycle of 13 rather 
than 11 years. The next cycle is also expected to be weak.) The result is given in the 
Table immediately below

 Table: Annual solar constants with 1361W/m2 subtracted. Along each row we have 10 years.

A few more comments:  (Dec 2019)
1.	We have done this exercise before in 2005 and 2011, and now in 2019. The status 
of the data (calibration) and availability (daily, annual etc) was very different at 
these three moments in time. Some basic uncertainties remain, both about N and TSI,  
for a casual user and different outlets exists. 
2.	The regression relating N to S has become weaker when adding the data for 2011-2018, 
which was a very weak solar cycle. One must acknowledge that data from 3 or 4 solar cycles 
is very little, and this situation will improve only slowly.  While the regression is based 
mainly on the quasi 11 year cycle, longer term changes enter the calculation. The last few 
years appear ‘anomalous’ by having near zero N, but not very low S. 
3.	We are ‘lucky’ to deal with this question at this time. Normally SWPC does not make 
forecasts for the next solar cycle until we are IN it. But on this occasion they made a 
forecast for cycle 25 while cycle 24 may not yet have quite ended.  It is difficult to know, 
in real time, the exact moment when cycle M ends and cycle M+1 starts. The forecast for 
cycle 25 (or what remains of it) will be updated  in the coming years, but a forecast for 
any year >= 2033 may not be given until well after 2030. 
4.	The numbers in the above Table for 2019-2033 need to be replaced when the observations 
become available, one for each year at some point in the next year. The new solar cycle 25 may 
give us surprises, so we should not rely on outdated values for the next many years.  When 
someone takes a serious look at the observations X years from now we also cannot rule out that 
more calibration has taken place and this would change the whole Table back to 1850 or 1750.
